DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics/data

The dataset was not included in this .zip since it's too heavy. Just a small part of the dataset was actually
exploited to perform the classification, I incuded a file ("preprocessing.py" under the "content" folder) which, given the original dataset as input (which
must be located under the same directory, "content" folder), produces as output a .csv file 
("preprocessed_lyrics.csv", located under the "content" directory) which lets you see the dataset that was 
exploited in most of the tests that are described in the .pdf file.

Please notice that each of the neural network samples we are going to discuss has been run on Codelab 
so each of the code provided needs the original dataset that was exploited "lyrics.csv", to be uploaded on your Codelab netbook to actually run correctly.
The .py files under each folder are meant to be pasted in the notebook.
I also added a commented section at the beginning of each of the files if you wish to run them locally: for this, you need to put the dataset "lyrics.csv"
under the "content" folder.

For the usage of each other folder and .py file, please see the report in the .pdf file in the main directory.
